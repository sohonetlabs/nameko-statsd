nameko-statsd
=============

A StatsD dependency for `nameko <http://nameko.readthedocs.org>`_, enabling
services to send stats.



Usage
-----

To use the dependency you simply declare it on the service and then you
can use it within any of the service methods (entrypoints, simple methods, etc.).


.. code-block:: python

    from nameko_statsd import StatsD, ServiceBase

    class Service(ServiceBase):

        statsd = StatsD('prod1')

        @entrypoint
        @statsd.timer('process_data')
        def process_data(self):
            ...

        @rpc
        def get_data(self):
            self.statsd.incr('get_data')
            ...

        def simple_method(self, value):
            self.statsd.gauge(value)
            ...


The ``statsd.StatsClient`` instance exposes a set of methods that you can
access without having to go through the client itself.  The dependency
acts as a pass-through for them.  They are: ``incr``, ``decr``, ``gauge``,
``set``, and ``timing``.

In the above code example, you can see how we access ``incr`` and ``gauge``.

You can also decorate any method in the service with the ``timer`` decorator,
as shown in the example.  This allows you to time any method without having
to change its logic.



Configuration
-------------

The library expects the following values to be in the config file you
use for your service (you need one configuration block per different
statsd server).  For example, if we had two statsd servers, prod1 and
prod2, we would have something like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    STATSD:
      prod1:
        host: "host1"
        port: 8125
        prefix: "prefix-1"
        maxudpsize: 512
        enabled: true
      prod2:
        host: "host2"
        port: 8125
        prefix: "prefix-2"
        maxudpsize: 512
        enabled: false


The first four values are passed directly to ``statsd.StatsClient`` on
creation.  The last one, ``enabled``, will activate/deactivate all stats,
according to how it is set (``true``/``false``).  In this example,
production 1 is enabled while production 2 is not.



Minimum setup
-------------

At the time of writing a Nameko service, you don't have access to the
config values.  This means that when we write our service we don't have
access to the actual dependencies (they are injected later).

In order to give the users of this library the ability to decorate
methods with the ``timer`` decorator, we need to do a little wiring
behind the scenes.  The only thing required for the end user is to write
the service class so that it inherits from ``nameko_statsd.ServiceBase``.

The *type* of ``nameko_statsd.ServiceBase`` is a custom metaclass that
provides the necessary wirings to any ``nameko_statsd.StatsD`` dependency.

If you cannot inherit from ``nameko_statsd.ServiceBase`` for any reason,
all you have to do is to make sure you pass a ``name`` argument to any
``nameko_statsd.StatsD`` dependency, the value of which has to match the
attribute name of the dependency itself.

The following configuration:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyService(ServiceBase):

        statsd = StatsD('prod1')

        ...

is equivalent to (notice it inherits from ``object``):

.. code-block:: python

    class MyService(object):

        statsd = StatsD('prod1', name='statsd')

        ...



The ``StatsD.timer`` decorator
------------------------------

You can pass any arguments to the decorator, they will be given to the
``statsd.StatsClient().timer`` decorator.

So, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyService(ServiceBase):

        statsd = StatsD('prod1')

        @entrypoint
        @statsd.timer('my_stat', rate=5)
        def method(...):
            # method body

        @statsd.timer('another-stat')
        def another_method(...):
            # method body

is equivalent to the following:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyService(ServiceBase):

        statsd = StatsD('prod1')

        @entrypoint
        def method(...):
            with self.statsd.client.timer('my_stat', rate=5):
                # method body

        def another_method(...):
            with self.statsd.client.timer('another-stat'):
                # method body



About the lazy client
---------------------

When you attach a ``nameko_statsd.StatsD`` dependency to your service, no
client is created.  Only when you use the dependency explicitly or when
you run a method that has been decorated with the ``timer`` decorator,
a client is created.

This lazy feature means you can attach as many ``nameko_statsd.StatsD``
dependencies to your service as you fancy, and no client will be created
unless it is actually used.
